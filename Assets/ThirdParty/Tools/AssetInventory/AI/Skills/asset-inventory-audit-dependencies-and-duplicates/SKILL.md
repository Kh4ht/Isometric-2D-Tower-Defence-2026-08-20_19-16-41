# Audit Dependencies and Duplicates

Run the narrowest dependency, usage, duplicate, or maintenance audit, inspect findings, and apply only supported fixes with explicit scope.

## When to use this skill

- Inspecting package or asset dependency graphs and project usage.
- Finding duplicate package entries or duplicate indexed media.
- Running database, preview, media, cache, and backup validators.

## Prerequisites

- Relevant packages and project assets are indexed.
- The audit target and whether fixes are allowed are explicit.

## Quick start

1. Choose dependency or usage analysis for relationships, or Maintenance validators for integrity.
2. Run the narrowest applicable analysis and wait for completion.
3. Inspect every finding and distinguish source files from generated cache files.
4. Apply only fixable results after explicit review, then rerun the audit.

## Workflows

### Workflow: Inspect dependencies and usage

1. Select the package or project scope.
2. Build the dependency or usage view.
3. Search and inspect graph and list details.
4. Report direct, transitive, missing, or unused relationships without deleting anything.

### Workflow: Run a maintenance validator

1. Open the Maintenance surface and filter to the relevant validator.
2. Run it and inspect database or filesystem findings.
3. Use Fix only when the validator advertises support and the exact targets are approved.
4. Rerun and confirm deterministic completion.

## Verification

- Analysis scope matches the request.
- Findings distinguish database rows, source files, previews, and caches.
- No non-fixable issue is presented as automatically repaired.
- A post-fix run no longer reports approved resolved items.

## API quick reference

- The current validator catalog contains database/index, preview/media, cache, and backup checks.
- `DuplicatePackageEntriesValidator` reconciles into a canonical row without deleting package source files.
- Generated preview cleanup must use cache-owned preview deletion paths.
- Dependency and usage views are read-only until a separate explicit action is invoked.

## Common issues

- **A duplicate name is not a duplicate identity:** Compare stable package records, source paths, foreign IDs, and versions.
- **A preview fix targets an original file:** Stop; generated-preview cleanup must never delete a `UseOriginal` source.
- **A validator cannot fix its result:** Report the issue and required manual action instead of inventing a repair.

## Boundaries

- Do not delete source package files during duplicate reconciliation.
- Do not infer unused status from one incomplete index.
- Do not extend or expose experimental search systems.
- Respect validator cancellation and supported fixability.
